	start algorithm design
	
Sep 3
	add and test new_room method with builds a new room in dungeon
	new_room unit test pass
	using generate new_room to build all rooms in dungeon
	fix issue on rooms are touching each other
	create a random room array, by returning Room struct pointer in generateRoom method
	
Sep 4
	improve pointer usage in array of room
	delete the use of pointer and redesign the algorithm to avoid potential memory array data corruption
